#### Reading Data from CSV File and Storing it in Custom Data Structure

The task, in short, is to read in a CSV file and obtain all its records
in a custom Rust `struct`. The source data are well-known ['Heart Attack Prediction' data set](https://github.com/kittenpub/database-repository/blob/main/heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv).

All further data processing, including work on model creation and around,
is carried out with [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
