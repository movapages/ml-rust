#### Polars: Finding Outliers in CSV

Outliers, usually those values below and or above given values, may be detected 
by means of _Polars_. However, the *downside* of this great library is its always
changing ___syntax___, which mutated from bitwise '&' to 'and' operators, and,
who knows, what it may be looking like in the future.

The good news are the existing library API is handy and compact as its methods
may be chained.
